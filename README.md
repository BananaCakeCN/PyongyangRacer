# How to play Pyongyang Racer?

Access [here](https://bananacakecn.github.io/PyongyangRacer) to play.

Adobe Flash Player of your internet browser is required. Unfortunately Flash emulator like ruffle won't work for Pyongyang Racer.

**DO NOT** run index.html locally, the game won't load at all because Flash block them accessing local files for security.

If you would like to run Pyongyang Racer locally, please run ``PYracer.swf`` outside the web browser.

# Issues

If you have your debugger of Flash turned on, you may noticed that when you collect a "sight" in game, there will be a window contains error messages pop on. That is because the detailed images of sights is missing. If you have those images, please contact me.
